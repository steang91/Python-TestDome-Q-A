#A university's Office of Admission keeps track of student majors. Each student can have a single major. Below is an example of how their system stores students, majors, and how it manipulates them:

students = [("Allen Anderson", "Computer Science"),
            ("Edgar Einstein", "Engineering"),
            ("Farrah Finn", "Fine Arts")]
     
def add_new_student(students, name, major):
    students.append((name, major))

def update_student(students, index, name, major):
    students[index] = (name, major)

def find_students_by_name(students, name):
    return [student for student in students if name in student[0]]

def get_all_majors(students):
    return [student[1] for student in students]

#What can be concluded from the code snippet above?

#(Select all acceptable answers.)

#YES##In the update_student function, the '(' and ')' parentheses can be removed without causing any errors.

#YES##Calling find_students_by_name(students, 'in') returns a list of 2 tuples.

#The add_new_student function can be rewritten as seen below and still maintain identical functionality:
#students[len(students)] = (name, major)

#Calling get_all_majors(students) returns a list of 3 tuples.

#YES##The add_new_student function adds a new student in the last place in the list.

#The name of the first student in the array can be set to the new_name variable, like students[0][0] = new_name
